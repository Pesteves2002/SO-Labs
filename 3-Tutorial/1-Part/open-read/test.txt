Have fun with ToggleCase and create crazy and wacky Readable Scrambled Text messages online for your Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace posts (or anything else for that matter). The great thing about ToggleCase is it's quick, easy, web-based, free, and completely awesome! After all, who doesn't enjoy a bit of Readable Scrambled Text madness every now and then? Should you ever need to reconvert your Readable Scrambled Text back to its original format, it's just a simple matter of repeating the above process again. To demonstrate the true power of ToggleCase here's an example of some Readable Scrambled Text you can create in just seconds, not donkey's years.
